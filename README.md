# Library System

This is a project developed during a bootcamp at GX2 Tec, refactored after 2 years using HTML, CSS and Javascript. It's a library system where you can add a book to the system, edit, desactivate, and view its history. All of this is achieved using local storage.

### Motivation

At the time, this project presented a significant challenge, and imposter syndrome often loomed over me. However, I've always enjoyed solving puzzles, so I knew that eventually, I would return to piece everything together until I saw that everything fit perfectly. That day has finally arrived!

### Evolution

I made a concerted effort to make the code as clear and clean as possible, and looking back at the previous version... Wow! What an evolution, Pamela! I finally understand the importance of clean code.

### Development Journey

Throughout the development process, I found myself making adjustments and additions, and everything seemed to flow naturally. A tweak here, another there, and boom... functions were working as expected, easy to understand, and simple. I'm filled with pride.
